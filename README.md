# YouSendStuff
Simple selfhosted file sharing webapp with password protected upload.

## Introduction
YouSendStuff is something you can host youself to share files. It's meant to be something like WeTransfer, only selfhosted and a bit simpler. You select a file, enter your password and you can send the link yourself.

## Installation
Well, YouSendStuff isn't finished yet, so there aren't any instructions on this.
